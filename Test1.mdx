# Welcome to MDX with React

This is a demonstration of how to use MDX with React components.

You can write markdown as usual, like **bold text** or _italic text_.

## Hereâ€™s a Sample Component

Below is a simple React component within an MDX file.

```jsx live
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '1rem', border: '1px solid #ddd', borderRadius: '4px' }}>
      <h3>Counter: {count}</h3>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrease</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
