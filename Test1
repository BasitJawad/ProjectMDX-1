### Explanation

- `import React, { useState } from 'react';` imports React and `useState` for the component.
- The `Counter` component allows users to increase or decrease a count.
- `<Counter />` renders the component inside the MDX file.

You would need MDX support in your setup, such as with Next.js or Gatsby, and the appropriate MDX plugins.
